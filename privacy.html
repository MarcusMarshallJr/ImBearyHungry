              Hi there! 
              <br><br>Beary Hungry is a paid iOS app that is provided “as is” on the iOS 
              App Store for $1.99 USD. 
              
              <br><br>This page is used to inform visitors regarding the app's policies 
              with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone 
              decided to use Beary Hungry.
              
              <br><br>If you choose to use Beary Hungry, then you agree to the collection
               and use of information in relation to this policy. Any Personal Information 
               collected is used to provide and improve the app. Beary Hungry will 
               not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
              For a better experience, while using the app, you may be required to provide Beary Hungry
               with certain personally identifiable information. The information requested will be 
               retained on your device and is not collected by Beary Hungry in any way.

              <br><br>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
              
              <br><br>Links to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app:
              <br><br>- <a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a>             
              <br>- <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">Firebase Crashlytics</a>

              <br><br>Additionally, Beary Hungry uses a service called Zomato to provide restaurant
               suggestions based on your location. To do so, Beary Hungry sends latitude and longitude
                values of your location to Zomato to find restaurants near you. However, you can choose
                to manually enter in any location if you prefer the app to not have your precise location.
                If you are interested in learning more about how Zomato uses the location data Beary Hungry
                sends them, you can see their privacy policy <a href="https://www.zomato.com/api_policy">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Log Data</h2>
            <p>
              Whenever you use Beary Hungry, in a case of an error in the app data and information
               is collected (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log
               Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
               device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing the
               app, the time and date of your use of the app, and other statistics.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
               identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
               stored on your device’s internal memory. The app does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
               However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
               information and improve their services. 
            </p>
            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>
              The app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
               directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by Beary Hungry. 
               Therefore, please review the Privacy Policy of these websites. Beary Hungry has no control
               over and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any

               personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case that a child under
