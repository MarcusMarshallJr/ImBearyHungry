# Privacy Policy

Hi there! 
Beary Hungry is an Ad supported iOS app that I am providing “as is” on the App Store at no cost to users. 

By choosing to use Beary Hungry, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

In a nutshell, the app does not collect or store any personal information about you. Information that is requested to make the app function, like your location, is only used to provide you with local restaurant suggestions and is not collected by me in any way. 

However, Beary Hungry does use a few third party services to help it function. Those services may collect personal information: 

### Google AdMob provides the apps advertisements:
I rely on advertisements to support Beary Hungry’s development. I use Google AdMob to display advertisements throughout the application. This service may collect information used to identify you. Google AdMob’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).

If you choose to click on an advertisement, you will be directed to an external website. Please remember that these external sites are not operated by me. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Please look over their privacy policies to see how they use your information. 

### Zomato provides some restaurant suggestions:
Beary Hungry also uses a service called Zomato to provide restaurant suggestions based on your location. To do so, Beary Hungry sends latitude and longitude values of your location to Zomato to find restaurants near you. However, you can choose to manually enter in any location if you prefer the app to not have your precise location. If you are interested in learning more about how Zomato uses the location data Beary Hungry sends them, you can see their privacy policy [here](https://www.zomato.com/api_policy).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please, review this page periodically for changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, email imhungrybear@gmail.com. 

Marcus, App Developer for Beary Hungry
