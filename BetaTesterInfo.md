## Important Beta Tester Info
---
*I would love for you to read this whole thing, but I know you may be busy. So, if you don’t have time to read these 5 paragraphs, skip to the bottom for a TL;DR summary.*


If you’ve never done this before, you’re in for a behind the scenes treat that many people never get to experience!  All I want you to do is use the app over the next week when you’re looking for somewhere to eat and tell me if the app helped make that decision easier. I’ll be sending out some targeted feedback surveys later in next week to get your thoughts about specific features in the app, but you don’t have to wait until then to give feedback when you see something you want to tell me about.

If you like something, tell me. If you don’t like something, tell me so I can do some more testing. If something confuses you, I want to know about it. If you have ideas for features or things you wish the app could do, I want those too. Any thoughts you have are valid thoughts. This whole beta process is to polish and refine the app before it’s released to the App Store.  I anticipate being able to finally release next Friday, May 29th. As you probably know, I wanted to release in March but development took longer than I was anticipating and I wanted to get as much as I could right before I released it. 

You can use this form [here](https://forms.gle/899HFmUn4VHe5maB9) to submit any feedback you have. It only asks you what iPhone you have and then lets you type out your feedback, so it’s just as easy as texting or messaging me. By using the form, you’re helping me keep all  of the feedback I get in one place instead of it being scattered around in text message threads, emails, and phone calls. The form is completely anonymous, so I won’t know who’s giving the feedback unless you choose to include your name at the end.

Last, there are a few issues with the app that I know about that I want you to be aware of. These will be fixed soon.
1. The app is not currently compatible with iOS 13’s dark mode, if you can’t see text, turn off dark mode and the text should return.
2. “Shake to get different suggestions” has NOT been implemented. It will in the next few days, but I haven’t added the code to make that work yet.
3. The “Directions” button has NOT been implemented yet. It will in the next few days, but I haven’t added the code to make that work yet.
4. The “See More Options” screen does not currently retrieve any photos of the restaurant, so a placeholder is there instead. This will be fixed before the app store release.
5. You can’t officially “rate Beary Hungry” since the app isn’t released to the App Store just yet, so the option to “submit” will be grayed out
6. The “Buy his dev a cup of coffee” button does not do anything at the moment. It will in the final release. Granted I would like your opinion on the inclusion of that button in the app. Would you ever press it? What would you expect it to do? And how much would you be willing to spend?

Thank you so much for being a part of this. ❤️ If you have questions about anything that I’ve mentioned or how to get the app downloaded, you’re welcome to shoot me a text! But remember if you want to give me feedback about the app, please use the form.


### TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read?)/ Summary
1. Use the app when you’re looking for somewhere to eat over the next week.
2. I want your honest feedback, opinions, and suggestions. You won’t hurt my feelings. In fact, I want your candid comments.
3. Use this [link](https://forms.gle/899HFmUn4VHe5maB9) to give me your feedback.
4. There are some known issues with the app that I plan on fixing soon. You can read about them in the 4th paragraph above.
5. Thank you so much ❤️
